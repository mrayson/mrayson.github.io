I am a physical oceanographer / environmental fluid dynamicist / numericist presently developing a three-dimensional circulation model for Galveston Bay, Texas using the [SUNTANS](http://www.stanford.edu/group/suntans/cgi-bin/index.php) ocean model code. The aim of this project is to develop a better tool for understanding the transport of oil within the bays and estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico. 

My general research interests include:

- Hydrodynamic modelling of coastal ocean and estuarine physics
- Tide-topography interactions including internal waves
- Transport processes in the coastal ocean

See my [Research](Research.md) page for more details.
