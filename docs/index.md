I am a [senior research fellow](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/matt-rayson) at the [Oceans Graduate School, University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/ems/Schools/Oceans-Graduate-School).
 My research specialises in physical oceanography with an emphasis on numerical modelling and
observing stratified flows on the continental shelf and coastal regions. My main work focuses on the metocean component of the [ARC Industrial Transformation Research Hub for Offshore 
Floating Facilities](https://www.offshorehub.edu.au/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Laboratory at
Stanford University, where I developed numerical modelling tools to study the circulation in the bays and estuaries along the Gulf of Mexico coast. I am an active user and developer of the [SUNTANS](https://github.com/ofringer/suntans) unstructured grid ocean model.

My general research interests include:

- Tide-topography interactions including internal tide generation
- Storm-generated near-inertial waves
- Nonlinear internal waves
- Hydrodynamic modelling of coastal ocean and estuarine physics
- Transport processes in the coastal ocean
- Transitions to turbulence (e.g., breaking internal waves)
- Uncertainty quantification of ocean dynamical quantities
- Any time-dependent, dynamic problems!

See my [Research](Research.md) and [Internal Waves](internalwaves.md) pages for more details.
